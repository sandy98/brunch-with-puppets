# Brunch with Puppets
A coffee skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) which utilizes [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

It's built on top of [Simeon Bateman's Brunch with Marionette](https://github.com/SimbCo/brunch-with-marionette) and as such draws heavily

Main languages are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Getting started
* Create new project via executing `brunch new <project name> --skeleton https://github.com/sandy98/brunch-with-puppets.git` option for the command.
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w` eventually adding `-s` in the latter case.
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:3333` or whatever port you chose by means of -p option.
* Turn the foundations to a complete building by enhancing and modifying the code at your heart's content.

## Dependencies
Versions of software the skeleton uses:

* jQuery 1.9
* Backbone 0.9.10
* Underscore 1.4.4
* Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2
