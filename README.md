# Brunch with Puppets

![image](http://sandy98.ods.org/img/puppets.jpg)

A coffee skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) which utilizes [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

It's built on top of [Simeon Bateman's Brunch with Marionette](https://github.com/SimbCo/brunch-with-marionette) and as such draws heavily
on that solid foundation, adding its bit of salt by means of enhanced main menu, including basis for user login, footer and some other goodies
soon to be included.

Main languages are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Getting started
* Create new project via executing `brunch new <project name> --skeleton https://github.com/sandy98/brunch-with-puppets.git` option for the command.
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w` eventually adding `-s` in the latter case. Same thing can be accomplished by `npm start`
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:3333` or whatever port you chose by means of -p option.
* Turn the foundations to a complete building by enhancing and modifying the code at your heart's content.

## Dependencies
Versions of software the skeleton uses:

* moment.js 2.0.0
* jQuery 1.9.1
* Backbone 1.0.0
* Underscore 1.4.4
